# mydnshost-containerlogger

This repo holds the code for the Container Logger for mydnshost.

A combination of Logspout and Logstash throw logs from our containers into RabbitMQ, this process then takes these logs and puts them into mongodb so that they can be accessed by the API.

## Running

This is probably not useful on it's own, see https://github.com/mydnshost/mydnshost-infra

## Comments, Questions, Bugs, Feature Requests etc.

Bugs and Feature Requests should be raised on the [issue tracker on github](https://github.com/shanemcc/mydnshost-containerlogger/issues), and I'm happy to receive code pull requests via github.

I can be found idling on various different IRC Networks, but the best way to get in touch would be to message "Dataforce" on Quakenet (or chat in #Dataforce), or drop me a mail (email address is in my github profile)
